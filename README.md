# Stockflare


Project divisions:
  . I divided the project by components. That is, the HTML files are in the "html" folder, the CSS files are in the "css" files,       the JavaScript files are in the "js" folder and the images are in the "img" folder.
  . The HTML, CSS and JavaScript files of a page have the same name. For example, the Stock Details page have 3 files. Have the         "stock_details.html", "stock_details.css" and "stock_details.js".
